GDI Utils
=========

I wrote these tools to help me while working with
Stud.IP as a tutor.

The code quality is mostly crap grade but they worked
well enough for me.

The utilities are:

undoit
------

Undoit takes the content of the the pile-of-crap .zip files
generated by the export function of the DoIt
feature integrated in Stud.IP and assigns the
submissions to a list of tutors in a deterministic fashion.

To use undoit you:

- Use the export feature in DoIt to download a .zip file
  that contains the submissions
- Unpack the .zip into a new folder
- Open a terminal in that folder
- Run `./undoit.py` to unpack the submissions

gradiator
---------

Gradiator scans a directory of submissions for
`.grade` files and generates a list of grades from
them or automatically sends mails to the students.

To find out how gradiator is used you should consult
its sourcecode, the file `gradiator.help` and the example
files.
